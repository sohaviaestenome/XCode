 # Basic Swift Classes

 ## Topic Essentials
 Even though swift has an entire library of built-in classes and structs for us to use in our applications, weâ€™ll still need to know how to create our own. These data structures can have properties, methods, initializers, and in the case of classes can have their own subclasses.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create a simple class called **Adventurer**
 + Declare instance properties with or without values
 + Define designated and convenience initializers
 + Understand reference type behavior

// Declaring a new class
class Adventurer {
    var name: String
    var maxHealth: Int
    
    var specialMove: String?
    
    init(name: String, maxHP: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.maxHealth = maxHP
    }
    
    convenience init(name: String) {
        self.init(name:name, maxHP: 100)
    }
    
    func prinStats() {
        print("Character: \(self.name), Max Health: \(self.maxHealth)")
    }
}

var player1 = Adventurer(name: "Harrison", maxHP: 99)
var player2 = Adventurer(name: "Manel")

var defaultPlayer = player1
defaultPlayer.name = "Bobby"
print(player1.name)
player1.name = "Zeca"

player1.prinStats()
player2.prinStats()
